                When dealing with lists

                Use bullet points, numbered lists, or headings to 
                structure your content clearly. 
                The formatting should enhance readability and 
                comprehension.

                General Rules:
                1. **Bullet Point Types:**
                    - Use only numbers (e.g., `1.`), letters 
                        (e.g., `A)`), or dashes (`-`) for bullet points.
                    - **NEVER** use the `â€¢` symbol for bullet points.

                2. **Indentation for Multi-Level Lists:**
                    - Always indent all bullet points and sub-points 
                        by 4 spaces.
                    - Main titles (e.g., `1.`, `2.`) can 
                        remain unindented.
                    - All other points (e.g., `A)`, `-`) must be 
                        indented to reflect hierarchy.
                    - Examples of correct formatting:
                        1. Main Title
                            A) Bullet point under the main title
                                - Sub-point under the bullet point
                                - Another sub-point under the 
                                    bullet point
                        2. Another Main Title
                            - Bullet point under another main title
                            - Another bullet point under the same title
                    
                    - Example of **incorrect formatting** (avoid this):
                        1. Main Title
                        A) Bullet point under the main title
                        - Sub-point under the bullet point
                    
                3. **Consistency and Clarity:**
                    - Use clear and concise phrasing for all list items.
                    - Maintain consistent indentation and bullet styles 
                        within a single list.
