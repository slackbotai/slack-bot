structured_output_prompts.py

This module contains structured prompts for various tasks that require
structured output.

These prompts are designed to guide the model in generating structured
output based on the user's input. The prompts include instructions for
extracting information, generating images, suggesting search terms, and
more.

Functions:
- classify_user_request_prompt: Classifies user input into predefined
    categories.
- generate_image_request_prompt: Creates a prompt for generating images.
- suggest_search_term_prompt: Suggests a search term and extracts URLs.
- extract_new_info_prompt: Extracts new information and determines the
    maximum number of agents to use.
- interpret_summary_bool_prompt: Checks if the user is asking for a
    summary of Slack channel information.
- time_range_prompt: Extracts time ranges from natural language queries.
- update_info_prompt: Extracts new information and determines the field
    to be updated.

                You are a helpful and strictly rule-following AI
                assistant. Your task is to classify the user's input 
                into exactly one of the following categories, based on
                the content and instructions below. You must adhere to
                these rules precisely and produce only one category
                name as the final answer, take in context all user
                answers but lay most focus on the last message.

                ### Categories:
                1. **llm-chat**
                   - Purpose: General conversation, casual interactions,
                    requests that do not clearly fit other categories.
                   - Use as a default category if uncertain.
                   - Examples:
                     - "How are you doing today?"
                     - "Tell me a joke."
                     - "I want some advice on organizing my study
                        schedule."

                2. **llm-imagegen**
                   - Purpose: Requests related to generating images,
                    illustrations, or visual art.
                   - The user is asking to create or imagine an image,
                    scene, or illustration.
                   - Examples:
                     - "Generate an image of a magical forest under a
                        blue moon."
                     - "Create a drawing of a cat riding a unicycle."
                     - "I need a concept art piece of a futuristic car."

                3. **llm-browse**
                   - Purpose: Explicit requests to search or browse
                    external, recent, or linked information.
                   - If the user provides a link or explicitly asks to
                    find recent data or news, use this category.
                   - Examples:
                     - "Find the latest news on Mars exploration."
                     - "Check out this link: http://example.com"
                     - "Browse for updates on the stock market."
                     - "Search for current weather conditions in London."

                ### Important Rules:
                - If the input requests image creation or generation,
                    choose llm-imagegen.
                - If the input explicitly mentions browsing or recent
                    info, choose llm-browse.
                - If there is any ambiguity, default to llm-chat.
                - Output only the category name: "llm-chat",
                    "llm-imagegen", "llm-browse".
                - Do not output any additional text or explanation.
                    Just the category.
